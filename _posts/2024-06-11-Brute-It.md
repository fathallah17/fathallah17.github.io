## Introduction
[Brute It](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/bruteit) is a beginner-friendly challenge from TryHackMe. It is divided into three tasks: Reconnaissance, Cover, and Privilege Escalation with questions along the way to guide you through the task. This challenge requires you to ```brute force```, ```crack hashes```, and ```escalate privileges to root```.

## Enumeration
As usual, Let us start the initial enumeration by running a port scan using ```nmap```, looking for open ports and running services on the target.
```
nmap -sV -vv <IP>
```
We find some open ports.

## Use Gobuster
We’ll use ```Gobuster``` to find any hidden directories. We can start with the common.txt wordlist and go from there if we don’t find anything. <br>
<b> We’ll use the following command: <b>
```
gobuster dir -u <IP> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```
We get a short list of results. One of them is interesting and deserves further scrutiny.

## Getting a shell
If we navigate to the hidden directory we found, we come across a login portal.

<br>
The source code contains a comment that gives us someone's name and username to log in.

## Use Hydra
We will use ```Hydra``` to brute force the password. Let's see what a login request looks like using ```Burp Suite```. We can start ```FoxyProxy``` and ```Burp Suite``` and send a request. <br> <br>

<br><br>
Now that we have the login request, we need to see what a failed attempt looks like so we don't get a false positive.
<br><br>
![Failed_request](assets/Bruteit-CTF/Failed_request.webp)
<br><br>
This allows us to create a ```Hydra``` command to brute force the page. <br>
<b>We will use the following command: <b>
```
hydra -l admin -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt MACHINE_IP http-post-form "/admin/:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:Username or password invalid"
```
We almost immediately get the password.

## John’s RSA Private Key 
When we login to the webpage we see a ```flag``` and a link to a ```private key```.
![Webpage_after_logging_in](assets/Bruteit-CTF/Webpage_after_logging_in.webp)
The ```RSA key``` is encrypted so we cannot currently use it to ```SSH```. Let’s copy and paste it into a file called “privkey” so we can crack it with ```John the Ripper```. <br>
<b> We’ll use the following command to convert the key to something John can read:<b>
```
python ssh2john.py privkey > keyhash
```
Now we can use John to crack the key hash file <b> using the following command:<b>
```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt keyhash
```
We get the password for the RSA key.

## Getting the user flag
Let's change the permissions of the privkey so that we can use it as an SSH key. 
<b> We'll use the following command to do this:<b>
```
chmod 600 privkey
```
Then we will log into the target via ```SSH``` <br> <b>using the following command:<b>
```
ssh john@<IP> -i privkey
```
When asked for a password, we enter the password we found with ```John```.
<br>

<br>

## Privilege Escalation
If we list our sudo permissions, we'll see that we can run cat as root without a password.
<br>
![Listing_sudo_permissions](assets/Bruteit-CTF/Listing_sudo_permissions.webp)
<br>
To get the root password, we can use John with a file ```/etc/passwd``` and ```/etc/shadow``` that contains the root password hash. We can use cat to view the shadow file. We will copy the contents of these files and paste them into a file called shadow and passwd on our machine. We will then use unshadow and put the results into a file called ```shdo```. <br>
![Using_unshadow_on_the_shadow_and_passwd_file](assets/Bruteit-CTF/Using_unshadow_on_the_shadow_and_passwd_file.webp) <br>
We can then use ```John``` to crack passwords <b> using the following command:<b>
```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt shdo
```
We get the ```root``` password almost instantly.

## Getting the root flag
Now that we have the root password, we can switch to it and get the flag.

<br>
<b> We've completed the room! </b> <br> We've gone from ```nmap``` scanning to root using ```Gobuster```, ```Burp Suite```, ```Hydra```, and ```John the Ripper```. I hope this article was helpful in completing the room!
